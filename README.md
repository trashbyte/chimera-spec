## Chimera is a (not-yet-extant) gradually-typed programming language with multiple dispatch as a core feature.

It is designed to be used in a wide variety of environments, from application development to embedded scripting to high-performance computing and more. It aims to be elegant and clean, easy to read and write, and yet packed with advanced features like coroutines, complex parametric types, and metaprogramming.

### Live version

You can see a (very early) live version of the working draft spec [here](https://chimera.trashbyte.io/spec/).

### Building

To build the site yourself, just run `python build.py`. You'll need:

 * Python 3
 * `mistletoe`
 * `pygments`
